    <h2 class="about-me-name">Deborah Imaji</h2>

    <p class="about-me-content">
        I am a 3d artist, a student, a frontend developer and an entrepreneur. Ever since I was a young girl, I have always had a passion for art and a passion for technology. Over time, I started learning different skills and techniques in these fields.
        <br>
        <br>
        Eventually, I discovered an exciting way to combine my love for art and technology: 3d Art. I soon realised that with 3d modelling software such as Blender and Maya, I could create cozy art. Now, I want to share my art with you.
